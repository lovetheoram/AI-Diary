# AI Module Technical Implementation Guide

This document covers only the AI implementation part of the AI Todo + Diary tool, assuming you're a beginner and need detailed step-by-step guidance.

## Core AI Features to Implement

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
2. **Perspective Memory (User Context Storage)**
3. **Task & Time Estimation Intelligence**
4. **Reflective Feedback Engine**
5. **Voice to Text Input**
6. **Sentiment Analysis & Mental State Detection**
7. **Learning Storage & Motivational Feedback Generator**

## 1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

### Purpose

* Parse user-written or spoken input.
* Extract intent (e.g., "remind me", "log a task", "today I learned").
* Extract entities like date, time, task names, mood.

### Libraries/Tools

* **spaCy** (for lightweight, local NLU)
* **transformers** + pretrained models (like `bert-base`, `distilbert`, `T5`, or `OpenAI GPT`)
* **Rasa NLU** (for scalable solutions with pipelines)

### Implementation Steps

1. Start with rule-based extraction using regex + spaCy.
2. Train small intent classification model using `scikit-learn` or `transformers`.
3. Store all tasks/entities in structured format (e.g., `{'task': 'finish report', 'time': '8PM'}`)

### Challenges

* Ambiguity in natural language.
* Language variations: "remind me", "ping me", "wake me up at" — all mean the same.

### Solution if Built From Scratch

* Use `spaCy` with `custom pipeline` components.
* Build an intent classifier using `TfidfVectorizer + LogisticRegression`.
* Gradually integrate larger models using HuggingFace.

## 2. Perspective Memory (Context Management)

### Purpose

* Remember user goals, decisions, emotional context.
* Recall key turning points (e.g., "You said: you’ll never quit halfway again").

### Tools

* Vector store (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB) to store user inputs as embeddings.
* Embedding model: `OpenAI embeddings`, `InstructorXL`, `SentenceTransformers`.

### Steps

1. Convert every diary/task/perspective input into vector (embedding).
2. Store it with timestamp, type, and emotion metadata.
3. Retrieve top-5 semantically related memories when needed.
4. Match it to today’s behavior → generate feedback.

### Challenges

* Vector drift: changing context over time.
* Cost of vector storage with OpenAI.

### Self-built Option

* Use `sentence-transformers` locally with FAISS.
* Embed every note using `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
* Store in SQLite + FAISS index.

## 3. Task & Time Estimation Intelligence

### Purpose

* Estimate time required based on task description.
* Compare vs. available time left.
* Generate urgent reminders.

### Tools

* Simple heuristics (rule-based initially).
* Fine-tune `T5` or `GPT` models on small data to estimate time.

### Steps

1. Build a small dataset: `Task → Expected Time` (e.g., 200 entries).
2. Fine-tune `T5-small` for task-to-time mapping.
3. Integrate with clock/calendar to generate alerts.

### Challenges

* User variability (fast vs. slow performer).
* Overfitting on small datasets.

### Self-built Version

* Start with heuristics: keywords like "read", "write", "watch".
* Assign average durations.
* Improve using feedback loop (user marks as completed in x mins).

## 4. Reflective Feedback Engine

### Purpose

* Help user stay aligned with declared purpose.
* Detect unconscious behavior shifts.

### Tools

* GPT-based summarizer.
* Rule-based or model-driven contradiction checker.

### Steps

1. Store user’s past commitments as structured sentences.
2. Compare current inputs or actions.
3. If contradiction, generate reflective message: *"You once said this. Today, you're..."*

### Advanced

* Use fine-tuned GPT or T5 to generate compassionate messages.
* Example prompt: "User said X on day1, now says Y, generate gentle reflective feedback."

---

## 5. Voice to Text Input

### Purpose

* Accept verbal input (mobile especially).

### Tools

* **Whisper by OpenAI** (for accuracy)
* **Vosk** (offline option)
* **Google Speech-to-Text API** (easy but not free)

### Steps

1. Record audio input.
2. Transcribe using Whisper/Vosk.
3. Feed result into NLU module.

### Self-built Approach

* Use `ffmpeg` to extract audio.
* Transcribe using `whisper`.
* Add UI progress bar + retry mechanism.

## 6. Sentiment & Mood Detection

### Purpose

* Detect user’s mental state.
* Tag entries with mood/emotion.

### Tools

* Pretrained models from HuggingFace (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`)
* `nltk + VADER` (simple)

### Steps

1. Run sentiment analysis on every diary input.
2. Store mood alongside entry.
3. Use mood trend charts in dashboard.

### Self-built Option

* Train a 3-class classifier (positive/neutral/negative).
* Use TF-IDF + Logistic Regression or BERT-based model.

---

## 7. Learning Storage & Motivation Engine

### Purpose

* Capture learnings.
* Prevent repetitive mistakes.
* Motivate user with past learnings.

### Tools

* GPT summarizer for learnings.
* Local database for saving key events.
* Embedding model + FAISS for smart retrieval.

### Steps

1. Every time user writes a reflection → extract learning.
2. Store it in a table with timestamp.
3. When user is struggling, retrieve 2–3 similar past learnings.
4. Generate motivating reflection: *“Remember this lesson from last month...”*

### Advanced Option

* Prompt GPT: *“User is demotivated. Remind them of past victories.”*
* Auto-inject a card in the dashboard or speak it aloud.

## Conclusion

The AI part is a layered combination of NLU, vector search, GPT-enhanced reflection, and memory-based motivation. You can:

* Start small with rule-based and gradually integrate ML models.
* Use OpenAI for heavy NLP until you can self-host or optimize.
* Focus on building a usable feedback loop — let AI guide and reflect.
