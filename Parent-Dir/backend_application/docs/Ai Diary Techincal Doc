# **Technical Documentation for AI Todo + Diary Tool**

## **1. Project Overview**

The AI Todo + Diary tool integrates daily task management, diary journaling, AI reflections, and motivational insights. The tool is built for energetic and ambitious users aged 15-50 and combines machine learning to track tasks, store personal learnings, and provide tailored reminders and guidance. It allows for input via text and voice, and processes this input to offer reminders, reflections, and motivation.

## **2. Architecture Overview**

### **Frontend**:

* **React** (for component-based architecture)
* **TailwindCSS** (for responsive, mobile-first design)
* **Redux** or **Context API** (for state management)
* **Axios** (for API calls)
* **Web Speech API** (for voice input handling)
* **Sentry** (for error tracking)

### **Backend**:

* **Django** (Web framework)
* **Django REST Framework** (for API endpoints)
* **JWT Authentication** (with Djoser or SimpleJWT)
* **PostgreSQL** (for persistent data storage)
* **Celery + Redis** (for background task processing, e.g., reminders, AI-driven insights)
* **OpenAI API** (for AI reflections and insights)
* **Docker** (for containerized deployment)

### **AI Integration**:

* **OpenAI GPT** (for reflections, motivation, and insights)
* **Whisper or Speech-to-Text API** (for voice-to-text conversion)

### **Hosting**:

* **AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)** (for production hosting)
* **AWS Lambda** (optional, for serverless functions like speech processing)
* **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD pipeline)

## **3. Functional Modules**

### **3.1 User Input Handling**

* **Text Input**: Users can type in tasks, diary entries, or goals. These inputs are categorized into task-related, emotional, or goal-related data using NLP techniques.
* **Voice Input**: Users can provide verbal input. Using **Whisper API** or an alternative, the speech is converted to text, and the system processes the input in the same way as text input.

**Process Flow**:

1. **Input Transcription** (for voice input).
2. **NLP Processing**: Categorize the input into tasks, emotions, goals, or reflections.
3. **Database Storage**: Store the processed data into appropriate tables (tasks, emotions, or goals).
4. **AI Reflection**: AI analyses user input based on past behavior and provides personalized insights.

**Technical Details**:

* **Voice Processing**: Voice input will be captured via **Web Speech API** (in the browser) or a mobile device’s native voice input.
* **Text Processing**: Use **spaCy** or **Transformers (BERT)** to classify and tag the input text as task, goal, or diary entry.

### **3.2 Task Management**

Tasks can be created, updated, completed, and deleted. Users can set time estimates, track completion time, and receive reminders.

**Features**:

1. **Task CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
2. **Time Tracking**: Tasks will allow users to set estimated completion times. The system will track actual time spent on tasks and generate comparisons.
3. **Smart Reminders**: Using AI, reminders will be tailored based on the urgency of tasks and user behavior patterns.

**Process Flow**:

1. User creates a task with a time estimate and priority.
2. The system tracks the task’s status and estimated vs. actual completion time.
3. If a task is not completed by the scheduled time, a reminder will be sent to the user.

**Technical Details**:

* **Database**: Tasks stored in a PostgreSQL table, which includes columns like `task_name`, `due_time`, `completion_time`, `status`.
* **Task Scheduling**: Use **Celery** with **Redis** to handle task delays, reminders, and any asynchronous operations.
* **Notifications**: Push notifications or emails for reminders, sent via **Django channels** or third-party services like **Twilio**.

### **3.3 Diary System**

The diary allows users to write journal entries. The AI analyzes these entries to provide summaries, detect patterns, and offer reflective questions.

**Features**:

1. **Diary CRUD**: Users can create, view, update, or delete entries.
2. **Emotional Context**: Each entry will have an emotional tag (positive, negative, neutral) for future reference.
3. **Reflection & Insights**: AI analyzes emotional trends in diary entries and offers personalized feedback.

**Process Flow**:

1. User writes or speaks a diary entry.
2. The AI analyzes the tone (positive/negative) and identifies any significant insights (e.g., recurring behaviors, emotional triggers).
3. AI sends reflection questions or motivational prompts based on analysis.

**Technical Details**:

* **Database**: Diary entries will be stored in a PostgreSQL table with fields like `entry_text`, `emotion_tag`, `timestamp`.
* **AI Processing**: **OpenAI GPT** will be used for reflection generation and motivational insights based on diary data.

### **3.4 AI-Powered Reflection & Insights**

This module will analyze the user’s behavior, uncover unconscious patterns, and provide reflective feedback.

**Features**:

1. **Behavior Analysis**: The AI compares the user's current behavior with past goals and motivational entries.
2. **Reflection Questions**: AI generates questions like “Why did this happen?” or “Are you aligned with your initial goals?”
3. **Motivational Prompts**: AI provides motivational messages or pep talks based on user data.

**Process Flow**:

1. Analyze user’s latest task or diary entry.
2. Cross-reference this input with past behavior (previous tasks, goals, or emotional patterns).
3. Generate insights, reflection questions, or motivational messages.

**Technical Details**:

* **AI Models**: Use **OpenAI GPT** to generate reflective prompts.
* **Database**: Store AI-generated insights with timestamps and associated tasks/diary entries for context.

### **3.5 User Dashboard**

Users can visualize their progress, task completion rates, emotional patterns, and AI insights.

**Features**:

1. **Daily Progress**: Show a progress bar indicating the percentage of tasks completed vs. pending.
2. **Alignment Score**: Measure how aligned the user is with their stated goals.
3. **Emotional Timeline**: Graph emotional trends over time, highlighting positive or negative mood patterns.

**Technical Details**:

* **Frontend**: Use **React** and **D3.js** for creating interactive data visualizations.
* **Backend**: Aggregate user data (task completion, mood tags) and expose it via APIs to the frontend.

## **4. Database Design**

The core database will use PostgreSQL to store user data, tasks, diary entries, AI reflections, etc.

**Tables**:

1. **Users**:

   * `user_id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
2. **Tasks**:

   * `task_id`, `user_id`, `task_name`, `due_time`, `completion_time`, `status`, `priority`
3. **Diary Entries**:

   * `entry_id`, `user_id`, `entry_text`, `emotion_tag`, `created_at`
4. **AI Insights**:

   * `insight_id`, `user_id`, `related_task_id`, `insight_text`, `created_at`
5. **Goals**:

   * `goal_id`, `user_id`, `goal_text`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`

---

## **5. APIs and Integration**

* **Task Management API**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks. Include endpoints for reminders and task time tracking.
* **Diary API**: Create and fetch diary entries. Include endpoints for emotion tagging and analysis.
* **AI Reflection API**: Interface with the OpenAI API to generate insights, reflections, and motivational prompts.
* **Authentication API**: JWT-based authentication for secure login and registration.

---

## **6. Deployment Strategy**

1. **Dockerize** the application (frontend and backend).
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use GitHub Actions to automate deployment to AWS or Railway/Render.
3. **Container Orchestration**: Use **AWS ECS** or **Kubernetes** for scaling the application in production.

---

## **7. Security Considerations**

* **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens for user authentication and refresh tokens to maintain sessions.
* **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest and TLS for data in transit.
* **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for task and diary APIs to prevent abuse (e.g., 60 requests per minute per user).
* **Brute Force Protection**: Implement login attempt throttling and CAPTCHA mechanisms.

---

## **8. Monitoring and Logging**

1. **Frontend Monitoring**: Use **Sentry** for tracking crashes and errors in the React app.
2. **Backend Monitoring**: Use **Prometheus/Grafana** to track system performance and API health.
3. **Logs**: Use structured logging for backend actions and database queries.
